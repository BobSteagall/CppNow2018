## Overview

This is the repo for my C++Now 2018 talks: 
* [Fast Conversion From UTF-8 with C++, DFAs, and SSE Intrinsics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5oczBeib_M&t=17s)
* Fancy Pointers for Fun and Profit
* [If I Had My ‘Druthers: A Proposal for Improving the Containers in C++2x](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAE0qteS4Rk)

All the code presented here is basically just snapshots; ongoing work will be found in other repos.  For my other C++ work, see my website [The State Machine](https://bobsteagall.com).
